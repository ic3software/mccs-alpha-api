  description: |
    ## Introduction 

    The MCCS Alpha Admin API v1 exposes all of the admin user functionality currently available in the [alpha version of the MCCS API](https://github.com/ic3network/mccs-alpha-api).

    By providing an API, developers who want to create their own front-end user interface for MCCS will have significant flexibility to implement it in whatever way they choose. This means developers can present MCCS in any language, setup their own signup flow, optimize it for whatever devices their users prefer, develop a mobile app, integrate other services such as chat, etc.

    Importantly, an API enables developers to integrate MCCS functionality directly into their own apps (e.g., import transfer data into an accounting application, instruct mutual credit transfers from an e-wallet application, interact with MCCS data via a chat bot, etc.).

    ## Background

    To understand how the MCCS Alpha API works, please read the following design documents:

    - [MCCS Alpha Data Model](https://github.com/ic3network/mccs/blob/master/alpha-data-model.md)
    - [MCCS Alpha Functionality](https://github.com/ic3network/mccs/blob/master/alpha-functionality.md)

    ## Test Server

    These API docs assume you are running the API server on your local machine using Docker & Docker Compose. See the [How to Start](https://github.com/ic3network/mccs-alpha-api#how-to-start) instructions in the project's GitHub repo for more details.

        An admin will need to authenticate with an email/password combination which, if successful, will result in a JSON Web Token (JWT) being passed to the admin to use with all subsequent Admin API requests.

        The JWT will expire after 24 hours, or as soon as the admin successfully calls the `/admin/logout` endpoint.
